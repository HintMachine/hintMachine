# HintMachine

HintMachine is a "BK Game" client designed to work for the well-known multiworld ecosystem [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago).

It connects to a wide variety of games (through RAM peeking, save file watching, etc...) to track progress on specific "quests" which, when completed, award random location hints inside the Archipelago world you are connected to.

Given its high dependency to system calls to do RAM peeking and stuff, only Windows is supported as of now.

## Usage

### Release versions 

- Download a release version's .zip file
- Extract it, and launch HintMachine.exe
- Connect to your Archipelago room by providing the hostname, the slot name and a password if there is one
- You can now connect to any game from HintMachine's library and profit

### Running from source 

- Download the source 
- Open the solution with Visual Studio 2017+
- It should generate & run right away
